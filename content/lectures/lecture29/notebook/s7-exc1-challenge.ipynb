    "From the exercise A.1, we observe that a single neuron is rather limited in what it can accomplish. But what if we expand the number of neurons in our network to make it more expressive? \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to **construct an MLP** learn its parameters from data using the **Keras** API which is part of Tensorflow 2.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a framework for representing complicated DNN algorithms and executing them in any platform, from a phone to a distributed system using GPUs. Developed by Google Brain, TensorFlow is used very widely today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a high-level API used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production. We will use tf.keras which is TensorFlow's implementation of the Keras API.\n",

    "- In our example, we have a single input, $x$  \n",
    "- The first layer consists of 2 nodes (or neurons), each with its own weight and bias used to perform an affine transformation on the nodes' respective inputs. We refer to this as the 'hidden' layer. \n",
    "- Both nodes in the hidden layer use the same activation function of the form $\\sigma\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ on their affine transformations.\n",
    "- The outputs of the hidden layer nodes must then be combined to give the overall output of the network. This is the output layer. Because we will interpret the output as a probability we just take a linear combination of the hidden layer and pass it through another sigmoid activation to produce the actual prediction, $y$.  Notice that the output layer has its own weights and bias.\n",
