    "Regular Expressions (RegEx) are a mechanism that allows one to define a pattern to be searched for. That is, Regular Expressions aren't just a Python concept or library; they extend beyond the scope of any one programming language. Fortunately, many programming languages support them, though. This makes string processing (namely, parsing) incredibly convenient, as it's vastly easier than writing our own search query (e.g., via a series of if-statements)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages slightly differ in their syntax for creating RegEx. RegEx's can quickly get tedious at times, and it is **not** expected for any student to memorize all of the possible character sequences or to become a master at them. We **do** expect you to know what they are and to have basic exposure to them, so that you are aware of their incredible utility and can use them in the future when you want to parse through text. It is perfectly permissible -- and expected -- for students to reference the syntax guide while creating RegEx. You will quickly learn that there are a few main, powerful character sequences that tend to get used over and over, and it's these that you will likely find useful for committing to memory:\n",
