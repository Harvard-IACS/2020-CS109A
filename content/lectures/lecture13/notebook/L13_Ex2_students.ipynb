    "For this exercise, we will be using the <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#boston-dataset\" target=\"_blank\">Boston house prices dataset</a> Boston house prices dataset that comes with `sklearn`. Specifically, we only care about 1 feature (aka predictor), the `CRIM` (crime) column, which is the very 1st column in the dataset and represents the crime per capital in each town. More info about the dataset and its columns are available <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#boston-dataset\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, run every cell. Try to find the errors and fix them. To be clear, bugs may exist in lines of code that are commented or not commented. Bugs may require you to add new lines of code or delete some lines of code. Also, our comments represent what we (the hypothetical student) wish for our code to do, so ensure that the code agrees with our comments. In other words, the bugs aren't in the comments, but are in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The funky comment lines like ### `edTest(test_a)` ### allow us to unit test and evaluate your code. Ignore those lines; do not edit them. Upon 'marking' your code, if you see a particular unit test doesn't pass, you can pinpoint the erroneous cell by its funky name (e.g., `test_a`)"
