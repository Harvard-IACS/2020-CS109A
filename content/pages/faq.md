# General
- **What lectures may I attend?**
- Registered students are free to attend any of the lecture times, regardless of which specific time they've registered for (e.g., you may attend 3pm lectures even if registered for 9am).
-  **Does the individual HW mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with my HW partner?**
  - Individual CS109A HW means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with partner.  You are allowed to use OHs to ask for clarification questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with your coding.  You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the HW, look at problem resolution online, and look at libraries documentation.
- **Do I have access to the video recorded materials if I am not an Extension School student?**
  - Yes. All CS109A students have access to all video captured materials. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID.
- **Where should I send my questions?**
  - Use Ed for anying related to the course content or assignments. All other concerns should be sent to the course helpline: cs109a2020@gmail.com

# Auditing

- **Can I audit this course? What are the rules for auditing?**
  - Yes, you are welcome to audit this course. Send an email to cs109a2020@gmail.com to request full Canvas access. All auditors must agree to abide by the following rules:
  	- All auditors are held to the same standard of academic honesty as our registered students. Please do not share homeworks or solutions with anyone. Violations will be reported to the Harvard Administrative Board.
  	- Auditors are not permitted to take the course for credit in the future.
  	- Auditors may not attend lectures or section during the live stream. Students are randomly assigned to small groups for coding exercises and mixing auditors and students in this way is not ideal. We are investigating methods that would allow auditors to join, but this is the current policy.
  	- Audiors should not submit HWs or participate in projects.
  	- Auditors should refrain from using any course and TF resources that are designed for our registered students like Ed, Jupyter Hub, and office hours.

# Projects
- **Can I do a custom final project?**
	- The teaching staff may approve a custom project if:
		- You have a group of at least 3 students interested in working on the project
		- You have a clear problem statement outlined in a project proposal for approval by the professors
		- You have access to the required data
		- The data is not private and can be shared with members of the teaching staff who will be guiding and evaluating the project

# Quizzes & Exercises
- **When are quizzes and exercises due?**
	- Quizzes and exercises are due before the next **9am** lecture.
- **I missed a quiz/exercise. Can I make it up?**
	- No. We will drop your lowest 25% of quizzes and your lowest 25% of exercises. This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz or exercise on occasion should not affect your final grade.
