# General

-  **Does the individual HW mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with my HW partner?**
  - Individual CS109A HW means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with partner.  You are allowed to use OHs to ask for clarification questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with your coding.  You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the HW, look at problem resolution online, and look at libraries documentation.
- **Do I have access to the video recorded materials if I am not an Extension School student?**
  - Yes. All CS109A students have access to all video captured materials. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID.
- **Can I make-up quizzes?**
  - No. Only your top 50% of quiz grades will count towards your final grade. This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz on occasion should not affect your final grade.

# Auditing

- **Can I audit this course? What are the rules for auditing?**
  - Yes, you are welcome to audit this course and attend lecture and sections. However, auditors should not submit HWs or participate in projects and should refrain from using any course TF resources that are destined and created for our registered students like Ed, Jupyter Hub, and office hours.
