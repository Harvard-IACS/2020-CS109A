    "\n",
    "What is PCA? PCA is a deterministic technique to transform data to a lowered dimensionality, whereby each feature/dimension captures the most variance possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we care to use it?\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Visualizating the components can be useful</li>\n",
    "  <li>Allows for more efficient use of resources (time, memory)</li>\n",
    "  <li>Statistical reasons: fewer dimensions -> better generalization</li>\n",
    "  <li>noise removal / collinearity (improving data quality)</li>\n",
    "</ul>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine some dataset where we have two features that are pretty redundant. For example, maybe we have data concerning elite runners. Two of the features may include ``VO2 max`` and ``heartrate``. These are highly correlated. We probably don't need both, as they don't offer much additional information from each other. Using a [great visual example from online](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues), let's say that this unlabelled graph **(always label your axis)** represents those two features:\n",
    "\n",
    "![VO2 Max vs Heart Rate](original_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that this is our entire dataset, just 2 dimensions. If we wish to reduce the dimensions, we can only reduce it to just 1 dimension. A straight line is just 1 dimension (to help clarify this: imagine your straight line as being the x-axis, and values can be somewhere on this axis, but that's it. There is no y-axis dimension for a straight line). So, how should PCA select a straight line through this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the image shows all possible projects that are centered in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Animation of possible lines](animation.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA picks the line that:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>captures the most variance possible</li>\n",
    "<li>minimizes the distance of the transformed points (distance from the original to the new space)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation **suggests** that these two aspects are actually the same. In fact, this is objectively true, but the proof for which is beyond the scope of the material for now. Feel free to read more at [this explanation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/32174/pca-objective-function-what-is-the-connection-between-maximizing-variance-and-m/136072#136072) and via [Andrew Ng's notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes-all/cs229-notes10.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, PCA is a math technique that works with the covariance matrix -- the matrix that describes how all pairwise features are correlated with one another. Covariance of two variables measures the degree to which they moved/vary in the same directin; how much one variable affects the other. A positive covariance means they are positively related (i.e., x1 increases as x2 does); negative means negative correlation (x1 decreases as x2 increases).\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science and machine learning, our models are often just finding patterns in the data this is easier if the data is spread out across each dimension and for the data features to be independent from one another (imagine if there's no variance at all. We couldn't do anything). Can we transform the data into a new set that is a linear combination of those original features?\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA finds new dimensions (set of basis vectors) such that all the dimensions are orthogonal and hence linearly independent, and ranked according to the variance (eigenvalue). That is, the first component is the most important, as it captures the most variance."

As with all models, you can't trust the results until you validate them- if you're going to use raw probabilities instead of just predicted class, take the time to verify that if you pool all cases where the model says \"I'm 30% confident it's class A\" 30% of them actually are class A."
