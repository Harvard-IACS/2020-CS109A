We'll be using several transformers that learn a transformation on the training data, and then we will apply those transformations on future data. With PolynomialFeatures, the `.fit()` is pretty trivial, and we often fit and transform in one command, as seen above with ``.fit_transform()`.\n",
                "- You rarely want to `include_bias` (a column of all 1's), since _**sklearn**_ will add it automatically. Remember, when using _**statsmodels,**_ you can just `.add_constant()` right before you fit the data.\n",
                "- If you want polynomial features for a several different variables (i.e., multinomial regression), you should call `.fit_transform()` separately on each column and append all the results to a copy of the data (unless you also want interaction terms between the newly-created features).

For example, $sin(24\\frac{x}{2\\pi})$, $sin(12\\frac{x}{2\\pi})$, $sin(8\\frac{x}{2\\pi})$. Other feature transformations are appropriate to other types of data. For instance certain feature transformations have been developed for geographical data.\n",

However, sometimes these polynomial features can take on values that are drastically large, making it difficult for the system to learn an appropriate bias weight due to its large values and potentially large variance. To counter this, sometimes one may be interested in scaling the values for a given feature.\n",
