Since real-world problems often require gathering information from a variety of sources, including the Internet, web scraping is a highly useful skill to have. To do this, we will scrape IMDb data on the highest-paid actors and actresses, extracting various key data points and using PANDAS to learn how to aggregate the data in useful ways.\n",

                "- Become familiar with how to scrape and use data from online sources.\n",
                "- Gain experience with data exploration and simple analysis.\n",

                "- Exercise **responsible scraping**. Web servers can become slow or unresponsive if they receive too many requests from the same source in a short amount of time. In your code, use a delay of 2 seconds between requests. This helps to not get blocked by the target website -- imagine how frustrating it would be to have this occur. Section 1 of this homework involves saving the scraped web pages to your local machine.\n",

                "- As you run a Jupyter Notebook, it maintains a running state of memory. Thus, the order in which you run cells matters and plays a crucial role; it can be easy to make mistakes based on *when* you run different cells as you develop and test your code. **Before submitting every Jupyter Notebook homework assignment, be sure to restart your Jupyter Notebook and run the entire notebook from scratch, all at once (i.e., \"Kernel -\u003e Restart \u0026 Run All\")**"
